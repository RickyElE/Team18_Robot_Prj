#### Motor
We will use the DC Motors to as our driver to move our robot. Then using the step motors as the actuator of robotic arm.

#### Sensor
We will use Ultrasonic sensor to detect the obstacles to avoid crashing.

#### Camera
We will use the camera to do some real-time work, like monitoring or controlling.

#### Wifi/Bluetooth
We will use the wireless technology to make remote-control and monitoring come true.
